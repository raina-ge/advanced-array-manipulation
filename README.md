# Advanced Array Manipulation in C

This C program demonstrates advanced array manipulation techniques with the following features:

- Dynamically generates arrays of random sizes (50-150 elements when using 3 iterations)
- Populates arrays with random numbers in exponentially increasing ranges (10, 100, 1000)
- Implements duplicate detection and removal (replacing duplicates with zeros)
- Compacts arrays by shifting unique values to the front
- Sorts unique elements in ascending order using insertion sort
- Includes formatted output (20 elements per line) and debugging macros

## Key Features

- Variable array sizes based on iteration count
- Progressive range scaling for random number generation
- In-place duplicate removal and array compaction
- Efficient sorting of unique elements
- Clean, formatted output for readability
- Debugging utilities for development

## Usage

Compile and run the program to see array manipulation in action:

```bash
gcc rge25_asn2.c -o array_manipulation
./array_manipulation
